# Internal Demos Repo

Customer demos and internal tools for creating demos

## Usage

Setting up demo environment:

```bash
make setup [API_DIR=/path/to/notte-api]
```

### Useful tools

- `iterate_options` from `options.py` to generate option combos for searching through reasonable setups
- [Chrome extension](https://github.com/nottelabs/notte-workflow-extension/releases/tag/v0) to record actions on DOM elements
- TODO make a script to format a prompt for higher reliability using some examples.

## Contribution

1. Drop polished final videos in this [Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VcED1nbtiK45WHXOWrdKoKffjolCfX1x)

2. Scripts to generate demos should be in "Storage" folder with a descriptive title
